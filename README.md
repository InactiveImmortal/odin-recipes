# Odin Recipes

This is the test of all of the basic HTML knowledge I have obtained from the Odin Project.

I am going to use this knowledge to build a basic recipe website. 

The website will have a main page with links to other pages.

I'll be honest, it is **NOT** going to look pretty, but that is what I am going to learn about later!
